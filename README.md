A project for hackclub blueprint to develop a raspberry pi pico powered authenticator stick with a custom made case and micro b to usb c adapter

I made the project because Im constantly forgetting my passwords so I wanted to use an authenticator, but I found out (atleast maybe due to shipping related costs) that developing the key myself with a 3d printed case and a pico and even a custom micro b to usb c male to male adapter would turn out cheaper, So I decided to do just that.

The software used for this project could be found at: https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido
I do not have the capability to write such software so I will be using that one personally, all credits on that code go to Pol Henarejos; The original coder. 

(this is optional, you can choose whatever software you want to run, I just happened to choose this one.)
