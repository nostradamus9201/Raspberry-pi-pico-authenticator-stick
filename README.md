# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Authenticator-Stick
A project for Hackclub Blueprint to develop a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 powered authenticator stick with a custom made case and a Micro B to USB C adapter PCB
 
# Why ?
I made the project because Im constantly forgetting my passwords so I wanted to use an authenticator, but I found out (atleast maybe due to shipping related costs) that developing the key myself with a 3d printed case and a pico and even a custom Micro B to USB C Male to Male adapter would turn out cheaper, So I decided to do just that.

The software used for this project could be found at: https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido
I do not have the capability to write such software so I will be using that one personally, all credits on that code go to Pol Henarejos; The original coder. 

(this is optional, you can choose whatever software you want to run, I just happened to choose this one.)

The case cover which will slide over the case to prevent the components from falling out, will lock the case in via the pinhole cutout
